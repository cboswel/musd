=================

The best starting point for understanding how FreeGSNKE works and how to use the code is to read the `FreeGS documentation
<https://freegs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ in its entirety. FreeGSNKE makes use of FreeGS objects and functionality, so understanding the FreeGS library first is essential.

To get started with using FreeGSNKE, first read the `home page <../index.html>`_ information from end to end. Then, read through and experiment with the example notebooks in the ``examples`` directory.

The notebooks are displayed statically on the following pages, but running them interactively and experimenting with the features is highly recommended.
